# Plan for a Week Without Google

*Plan a week without Google.* There are a lot of ways to interpet this week's homework prompt for Taeyoon's class. My goal for this assignment is to find some free, open, and privacy-focused alternatives to Google products and integrate them sustainably into my life. I'd like to keep this assignment going as long as I can.

## Web Browser
I currently use Google Chrome as my main browser on both my laptop and smartphone, so I'm going to have to switch to  alternatives. For my laptop, I'll probably go with FireFox, because Mozilla is non-profit with a strong committment to privacy that doesn't make money off of user data, and FireFox has most/all of the modern APIs/features that I need in a web browser as a programmer who frequently works in JavaScript. I could also use Safari, but they haven't done a great job of keeping up with the JavaScript browser API specs.

If I really wanted to commit to a private browsing experience, I could also set up the Tor Browser, a modified version of Firefox that routes all internet connections through the Tor onion network for anonymized browsing.

Since there isn't a FireFox app for iOS, I'm going to use Safari when I'm browsing on my phone.

## Search
For search, I'll set my browser's default search engine to DuckDuckGo. DuckDuckGo is a search engine that doesn't collect personal information on its users, and relies on its community to provide a search experience of similar(ish) quality to Google. Their business model appears to be ad-based, which is not ideal, but we live in an imperfect world and there aren't a lot of ways for a privacy-focused search company to sustainably exist within a capitalist system.

## Email
Gmail is probably going to be the hardest to get away from. I could make a new email account with a more free and open email provider such as [riseup.net](https://help.riseup.net/en/email), but everyone that wants to contact me is still going to be sending email to my gmail address.

It's unlikely that I'll be able to convince everyone that I know to contact me at my new email account in the space of a week, but maybe this is one of those assignments that I start during Taeyoon's class and spend a much longer time finishing. As a first step, I've contacted someone I know who uses riseup.net to see if they'll give me an invite code for an email account.

## Maps
I use Google Maps on my smartphone a lot for public transit/biking directions in NYC. Going without a transportation app would be really difficult, but it's also hard to tell which apps sell your data. There's an app called Citymapper that I really like using, but their app is free and their business model is unspecified, so they probably rely on selling user data to make money. For now, I'll try using the built-in Apple Maps app on my iPhone, since Apple seems to make an effort to [respect privacy](http://www.apple.com/privacy/approach-to-privacy/).

## Docs
[pad.riseup.net](https://pad.riseup.net/) offers an ephemeral alternative to Google Docs that does not track IP addresses, requires that all connections route through HTTPS, and can optionally be accessed as a Tor hidden service (an anonymized server in the Tor network). The tradeoff (could be a downside or an upside) is that pads are deleted after 30 days of inactivity, but I don't think that my typical usage of Google Docs involves keeping documents around for a long time without looking at them. Honestly, I don't even use Google Docs that much.

Another alternative could be [hackpad](https://hackpad.com/), which seems to work well for SFPC.

## Facebook

This isn't a Google service, but I've been feeling really uncomfortable about using Facebook for a while now (primarily because of how it affects my social life and behavior, but also because of how it affects my privacy), and this seems like a good opportunity to deactivate my Facebook account for a week (or longer) and see how it feels.
