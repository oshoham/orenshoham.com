Our first assignment for Taeyoon's class Poetics and Politics of Computation is to write a blog post on the history of the Bell Laboratories building. So, without further ado...

463 West Street, New York, NY, (now Westbeth Artists Housing, where SFPC is located) was built in 1900 by Western Electric, a subsidiary of AT&T that manufactured telephones, as part of a factory and research complex. The building was designed (at least in part) by Cyrus L. W. Eidlitz, an architect best known for designing One Times Square, the former New York Times building from which Times Square got its name. 463 West Street was the home of Western Electric Research Laboratories until 1925, when the Research Laboratories were consolidated with part of AT&T's engineering department to form Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., at which point the building became known as the Bell Laboratories Building.

From 1925 to 1966, the Bell Laboratories Building was the central headquarters of Bell Labs. In 1942, a new location for Bell Labs was constructed in Murray Hill, NJ, and research facilities were gradually moved there, but the Manhattan location remained in use until 1966.

# A Few Notable Events
- In 1948, in the top-floor auditorium of the Bell Labs Building. the transistor is introduced to the world by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley.
- Also in 1948, Claude Shannon publishes his landmark paper *The Mathematical Theory of Communication*, creating the field of information theory.

# When Turing Met Shannon

For a few months in early 1943, the Bell Labs Building was also the site of a meeting between two of the most important figures in the history of computing.

In the midst of World War II, a mathematician and electrical engineer named Claude Shannon was working on fire-control systems and cryptography for the U.S. military at Bell Labs. This was still relatively early in Shannon's career, but even then, he had already made hugely important contributions to computing; his 1937 master's thesis at MIT had shown that electrical relays and switches could implement Boolean logic, a finding which was crucial to the development of the digital computer.

A few years later, in 1948, Shannon would go on to found the field of information theory with his seminal paper *The Mathematical Theory of Communication*, which essentially showed that all forms of human communication - text, images, sound, etc. - could be encoded as binary numbers, and that these encoded messages could be transmitted over communications channels without error.

But, back in 1943, information theory was still just a gleam in Shannon's eye. Meanwhile, a British mathematician and cryptanalyst named Alan Turing had come to visit Bell Labs for several months in order to
